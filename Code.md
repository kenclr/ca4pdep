Most of the code files use R. The code in each can be executed if you use RStudio. In addition, these *.Rmd files were "knit" via RStudio, creating HTML files that show the output of the executions. In each code file, further details refer to the sections in the above working paper.

- PDEP-CA-00.Rmd: Accessing Online PDEP Feature Files - Describes how to create cross-tabulations online and showing how the tables (data frames) can be modified for further analysis. (Originally, the descriptions for all other markdowns worked with desktop files. These same files have been available online, totally 1.2 GB of features, for 81,000+ sentences, and almost 96 million features. In the other descriptions, several comma-separated values were specified.) (https://www.clres.com/ca/pdepca00.html)
- PDEP-CA-01.Rmd: Cross-Tabulation of PDEP Features (Section 3) - Showing how an initial contingency is generated, characterizing how to interpret the major parts of correspondence analysis. (https://www.clres.com/ca/pdepca01.html)
- PDEP-CA-01a.Rmd: Demo for correspondence analysis, using the same data as in the previous code, following an online description that provides a comprehensive example. (https://www.clres.com/ca/pdepca01a.html)
- PDEP-CA-02.Rmd: Instance Analysis (Section 4) - Showing how individual corpus instances (sentences) can be examined with the techniques of Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). (https://www.clres.com/ca/pdepca02.html)
- PDEP-CA-03.Rmd: Dictionary Analysis (Section 5) - Performing a correspondence analysis for a dictionary corpus and then using that as an anchor contingency table to be studied against two comparison corpora identifying where senses are located in a factor map.
