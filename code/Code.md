This project explores methods that can analyze features created in parsing the sentences (instances) used in the Pattern Dictionary of English Prepositions (PDEP). This project will focus on the use of the techniques of correspondence analysis (CA) to examine the similarities between preposition senses.

This project will primarily use the R correspondence analysis package "FactoMineR", with further use of the package "ca". The project will use Python scripts to create the data that analyzed with the CA techniques.
